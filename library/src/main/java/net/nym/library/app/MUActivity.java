     * Perform any final cleanup before an activity is destroyed.  This can
     * happen either because the activity is finishing (someone called
     * {@link #finish} on it, or because the system is temporarily destroying
     * this instance of the activity to save space.  You can distinguish
     * between these two scenarios with the {@link #isFinishing} method.
     * <p/>
     * <p><em>Note: do not count on this method being called as a place for
     * saving data! For example, if an activity is editing data in a content
     * provider, those edits should be committed in either {@link #onPause} or
     * {@link #onSaveInstanceState}, not here.</em> This method is usually implemented to
     * free resources like threads that are associated with an activity, so
     * that a destroyed activity does not leave such things around while the
     * rest of its application is still running.  There are situations where
     * the system will simply kill the activity's hosting process without
     * calling this method (or any others) in it, so it should not be used to
     * do things that are intended to remain around after the process goes
     * away.
     * <p/>
     * <p><em>Derived classes must call through to the super class's
     * implementation of this method.  If they do not, an exception will be
     * thrown.</em></p>
